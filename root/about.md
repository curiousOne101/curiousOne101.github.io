# About Jamie Young


Jamie Young is a self-optimization aficionado that has been utilizing self-optimizing strategies and tactics based on research from the areas of physiology, neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience and positive psychology. 

Jamie believes in utilizing objective metrics to establish a baseline and iterate for progress, for without a reliable accurate measure of key performance indicator's how can one truly know their progress ? CEO's use KPI's to track their business performance but often fail to apply this to the self, it is time to change this. For how the self performs is magnified in how the business performs.
